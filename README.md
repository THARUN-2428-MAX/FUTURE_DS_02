Summary of Task 2: Sales Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

Objective: Use historical sales data to predict future sales trends.

Skills Gained: Time series modeling, data preprocessing, forecasting techniques.

Tools Suggested:

Python (Pandas, Statsmodels) for data analysis and modeling.

Tableau for visualization of results.


Deliverables:

Forecast models showing predicted sales trends.

Business recommendations based on the analysis.



Sample Dataset:
Access the dataset from Kaggle's Store Sales Time Series Forecasting Competition.

Steps to Complete:

1. Collect Data: Use the provided dataset or another relevant dataset.


2. Preprocess Data:

Handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies.

Format the data for time series analysis.



3. Model the Data:

Use Python libraries like Statsmodels to create time series models (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA).

Analyze seasonality, trends, and cyclic patterns in the data.



4. Evaluate and Validate:

Use appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAPE) to evaluate model accuracy.



5. Visualize Results:

Use Tableau or similar tools to create dashboards showing historical and forecasted trends.



6. Provide Insights: Prepare recommendations for business decisions based on forecasted sales patterns.
